## Integrating your Linux Heap Memory Management Library into your Poky Build

This document provides instructions on integrating your custom Linux heap memory management library into your Poky build environment.

### Prerequisites

* A Poky directory set up.
* Your Linux heap memory management library source code available.

### Integration Steps

1. **Navigate to your Poky directory:**

   ```bash
   cd <your-poky-dir>
   ```

2. **Source the build environment:**

   ```bash
   source oe-init-build-env build-hmm/
   ```

3. **Add your library layer:**

   ```bash
   bitbake-layers add-layer /path/to/layer/meta-HMM
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/layer/meta-HMM` with the actual path to your library's meta layer directory.

4. **Ensure layer inclusion in local.conf:**

   Open the `conf/local.conf` file and add the following line, replacing `<your-layer-name>` with the actual name of your meta layer:

   ```
   BBLAYER += "<your-layer-name>"
   ```

5. **Build the image:**

   ```bash
   bitbake image
   ```

This will build your Poky image with your custom heap memory management library integrated.
