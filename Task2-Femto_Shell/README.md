## Introduction

The WAFDUNIX Shell is a minimalistic command-line interface implemented in C. It initializes a simple shell environment and waits for user input. Users can input commands, and the shell will respond accordingly.

## Features

- **Command Input:** Users can input commands in the shell.
- **Exit:** The shell can be terminated by typing "exit" at the prompt.

## Usage


1. Build the executable:

    ```bash
    gcc wafdunix_shell.c -o wafdunix_shell
    ```

2. Run the shell:

    ```bash
    ./wafdunix_shell
    ```

3. The shell will display a welcome message, and the user can input commands.

## Building
